## Advanced Machine Learning

This repository consists of the various datasets and algorithms I learnt in the Advanced Machine Learning and Optimisation class

#### File-IRLSandML
* IRLS - One approach to fitting a generalized linear model (GLM) - naive iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS).
* Using various approached like forward model selection(AIC,BIC), lasso, ridge regression to choose the best model to predict in the prostrate cancer dataset
